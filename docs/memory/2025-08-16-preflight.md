# Preflight snapshot â€” 2025-08-16

Context: apps/api src unit tests import-order lint errors blocked `npm run lint` with `--max-warnings=0` at root.

Actions taken:
- Fixed import/order in:
  - apps/api/src/tests/unit/leaderboard.service.test.js
  - apps/api/src/tests/unit/users.service.test.js
- Re-ran quality gates:
  - Lint: PASS (0 errors, 0 warnings at root target)
  - Unit tests: PASS (cursor-security, reputation-decay, onboarding, cache, auth-refresh)
  - Integration: PASS (contracts, funds, barter, trustcap, leaderboard, mentor-flow, fraud-risk, contract-risk, leaderboard-abuse-stats, leaderboard-weak-secret, ws-auth, marketplace-idempotency)

Notes:
- Env warnings observed during some tests: `[env] warnings CURSOR_SECRET:weak` (expected for tests; no failures). In weak-secret test, `[env] errors CURSOR_SECRET:invalid` is intentional.
- No behavior change; production code untouched.

Quality gates summary:
- Build: n/a (Node)
- Lint/Typecheck: PASS
- Unit tests: PASS
- Integration tests: PASS

Artifacts:
- Only test file import ordering changed; no runtime code modified.
