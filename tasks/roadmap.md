## CURRENT FOCUS (Next Actions will be seeded from here):
These tasks will automatically populate docs/status.md Next Actions

## STOP DOING (No more docs/memory tasks):

- ~~MVP: Hafıza dosyaları + roll-up action + PR şablonları~~ (ENOUGH DOCS!)
- ~~Gelişim: Auto-task issue template ile iş akışı~~ (ENOUGH DOCS!)
- ~~Any more memory rollup tasks~~ (FOCUS ON CODE!)
- ~~Any more documentation tasks~~ (CODE FIRST!)
- ~~Any more CI/CD tasks~~ (CORE FEATURES FIRST!)
